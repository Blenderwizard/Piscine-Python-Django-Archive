<h1>Django</h1>
<h2>Meet Django</h2>
<p>
	Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. <br />
	Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus  <br />
	on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
</p>
<h2>Django History</h2>
<p>
	Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, <br />
	Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired <br />
	early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended. It was released publicly <br />
	under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt. Adrian <br />
	Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player and a big fan of Django Reinhardt. <br />
	<br />
	In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django <br />
	in the future.
